Hooks are ideal for handling logic that is used across 
multiple components, such as form handling (useForm), 
fetching data (useFetch), or managing UI elements 
like modals and sidebars (useModal, useSidebar). 
By using hooks, you keep your components cleaner and more 
focused on rendering, while the reusable logic is
 abstracted into the hooks.


Global state is useful for handling global states such as 
user authentication (AuthContext),
(CartContext), or theme settings. Global state management 
provides a centralized way to manage shared state.
