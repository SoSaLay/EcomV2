Pages:
The pages folder contains the main UI views that 
correspond to different routes in your application. 
Each file or subfolder in pages represents a full page 
view, such as the homepage, category page, checkout page, 
etc. These pages orchestrate the layout and 
structure of the application by combining various 
components to form a complete view. 
They are the entry points for different
 sections of your app and are typically used with a 
 routing library to handle navigation.

Components:
The components folder contains reusable UI elements that 
are used across multiple pages. These components are 
building blocks that can be composed together to create the
 views within the pages. Examples include buttons, forms,
  navigation bars, footers, and cards. Components are
   focused on encapsulating specific pieces of UI 
   functionality and logic, making them reusable and
    easier to manage.

Relationship:
Pages use components to construct the complete UI views.
